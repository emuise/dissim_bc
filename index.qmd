**Abstract**

Recent conservation strategies have increasingly emphasized the importance of ecosystem quality and condition, alongside spatial extent, as integral for effective biodiversity conservation. This paradigm shift acknowledges that high-integrity, intact ecosystems are disproportionately valuable, and under increasing pressure. However, despite this recognition, detailed spatial information on the location and extent of high-integrity forests and ecosystems remains limited. We address this critical gap by developing and applying a robust framework to map forest structural and functional integrity across the forested ecosystems of British Columbia, Canada (BC). Our methodology integrates coarsened exact matching with the sigma dissimilarity metric to quantify ecological integrity while explicitly accounting for environmental heterogeneity. The majority of BC (\~80%) has a perfectly matched protected reference state to compare to and that the majority of BC's forested ecosystems have high structural integrity or high functional integrity. Combining both metrics led to less of the province being considered high-integrity, likely due to the low information overlap of the two datasets. Disturbances generally led to a reduction in structural and functional integrity, with harvesting showing the strongest reductions. Both fire and harvesting showed similar rates of recovery, with fires being more variable, potentially due to the range of fire severity found across the province. Anthropogenic pressures also reduced the proportions of high-integrity forests, which was most apparent in structural attributes. Protected areas not included in the reference state (under anthropogenic pressures or recently disturbed) did not show large differences in high-integrity forest proportions from unprotected areas. This methodology combining pixel matching and sigma dissimilarity approaches provides comprehensive information on forest integrity in a wall-to-wall fashion, and can provide valuable insights to guide conservation planning and management efforts.

# Introduction

Forests with high ecological integrity provide critical ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, habitat provision, and water regulation [@watson2018]. These high-integrity forests are essential for sustaining biodiversity, as they possess natural or near-natural levels of structure, function, and composition [@pillayKunmingMontrealGlobalBiodiversity2024; @hansen2021]. However, these intact ecosystems are under threat from anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, resource extraction, and land-use change. In response, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), has set out targets to protect 30% of the terrestrial area, with a focus on high-integrity ecosystems, and have 30% of degraded ecosystems under effective restoration to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem function by 2030 [@conventiononbiologicaldiversity2023]. Accurately identifying high-integrity forest ecosystems and forests in need of restoration therefore requires robust assessment methods that account for ecological variability and human pressures [@hansenPolicydrivenFrameworkConserving2020].

One established methodology to assess ecological integrity is by comparing the ecosystem in question to a reference state, which represents what the ecosystem would look like in the absence of significant anthropogenic disturbances [@tierney2009; @hansen2021]. Reference states provide benchmarks that forest conditions can be compared to, guiding conservation strategies and policy implementations [@andreasen2001]. However, defining appropriate reference conditions can be challenging due to the range of environmental conditions across a landscape and the complexity of ecological systems [@nielsen2007; @mcnellieReferenceStateBenchmark2020]. Counterfactual thinking and matching techniques have emerged as potential methods to develop locally consistent reference states which account for environmental conditions, allowing suitable comparisons to be made across entire landscapes or regions [@ferraro2009; @schleicher2020].

Satellite remote sensing has also emerged as a useful tool for assessing ecological integrity, generating many of the biodiversity indicators useful for assessing ecosystem structure, function, and composition [@skidmore2021; @pereira2013]. Satellite-derived information on forest structure [@matasciLargeareaMappingCanadian2018; @matasciThreeDecadesForest2018], energy availability [@radeloffDynamicHabitatIndices2019; @razenkovaMediumresolutionDynamicHabitat2025], and leading tree species [@hermosillaMappingPresenceDistribution2022] are increasingly becoming available across entire jurisdictions, enabling satellite-driven ecological integrity assessment at the landscape scale. The integration of biodiversity indicators derived from these datasets with matching techniques facilitates the determination of a forest stand's deviation from expected ecological conditions, thereby enabling the forest ecological integrity assessment on a wall-to-wall basis.

Importantly, assessing ecological integrity provides a science-based foundation for conservation planning across entire jurisdictions by identifying areas that contribute the most to providing biodiversity and ecosystem functions [@buotteCarbonSequestrationBiodiversity2020; @diasUsingEssentialBiodiversity2023; @diazBiodiversityForestCarbon2009]. These integrity estimates can be used to generate more holistic assessments of progress towards international conservation targets beyond simply considering spatial coverage of protected areas [@pillayKunmingMontrealGlobalBiodiversity2024; @ferrier2024]. Further, these metrics can be used for protected area prioritization at the stand and ecosystem scales [@hansenPolicydrivenFrameworkConserving2020]. At the fine spatial scale, these metrics can be used to identify high-integrity forest stands to focus on for protection or restoration, and at the coarse scale, they can be used to assess connectivity in addition to assessing protected area network effectiveness.

In this paper, we develop and apply an approach to derive the structural and functional integrity of the forest ecosystems of British Columbia using a combination of matching techniques and satellite derived indicators of forest structure and function. We assess reference state availability across British Columbia, and use estimated ecological integrity values to identify areas potentially suitable for conservation or restoration implementation, and assess the proportion of each ecosystem with high ecological integrity and low anthropogenic pressures. This information will allow managers to advance conservation planning in two ways: at the pixel scale identifying high-integrity forest stands for protection or restoration, and at the ecosystem scale when assessing progress towards conservation targets.

# Methods

## Overview

We calculated forest ecological integrity estimates for each biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification (BEC) zone in British Columbia. We accomplished this by using a two-phase approach. First, we matched all forest stands in the province to a reference state, found within the protected area network without anthropogenic pressures or recent forest disturbances, based on similar climatic and topographic conditions, by ecosystem and forest type. We assess match quality based on distance from similar environmental conditions and the availability of undisturbed protected areas within ecosystems. We then calculated the sigma dissimilarity [@mahonyCloserLookNovel2017] for every forested pixel in the province for forest structural, functional, and structural + functional attributes to their matched reference states. By combining the sigma dissimilarity metric with an anthropogenic pressure layer, we identify areas of the province suitable for protection (low dissimilarity; low pressure), and restoration (high dissimilarity; low-high pressure). We reclassify the sigma dissimilarity layer into similar and dissimilar categories, based on a cutoff of two standard deviations. We report the proportion of similar/dissimilar forests for ecosystems and the entire province. This information can aid protected area managers and policy makers with conservation and restoration prioritization, and gives insight into the effectiveness of protected areas of different classes.

## Study Area

We focus our efforts on the forested areas British Columbia, Canada (BC). British Columbia's 92.5 million ha of terrestrial area is divided into 16 ecosystems based on the biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification (BEC) system [@pojarBiogeoclimaticEcosystemClassification1987], with approximately 64% of the landbase being forested [@bcministryofforestsBritishColumbiaForests2003]. These ecosystems are classified based on climax tree species, as well as marcoecological gradients such as climate, soil, and topography [@meidingerEcosystemsBritishColumbia1991]. Information on the spatial boundaries of the BEC zones were obtained using the **bcmaps** R package [@teucherBcmapsMapLayers2021]. Large gradients of elevation, precipitation, and temperature exist in the province, with much of the landmass being in mountainous terrain. Fire is a common disturbance across the province, although the historic fire regime has been disrupted in the past few centuries [@brookesDisruptedHistoricalFire2021]. Silviculture is a common industrial activity in the province, with approximately 136,000 ha of the land base harvested per year [@canadiancouncilofforestministersNationalForestryDatabase2023].

British Columbia's protected area network is vast, encompassing approximately 15.4% of the terrestrial area of British Columbia, with variations in coverage by ecosystem [@muise2022]. Protected area coverage has been shown to be biased towards high elevation, low productivity ecosystems and land covers, which follows global trends in protected area placement [@muise2022; @joppa2009]. Protected areas in British Columbia and Canada are mandated towards conserving ecological integrity [@bcparksEcologicalIntegrityBritish2012; @governmentofcanadaCanadaNationalPark2019]. Protected areas within the province were first established in 1911, and protected areas have continually been added in a range of sizes since. We obtained protected area boundaries for British Columbia using the **wdpar** R package [@hansonWdparInterfaceWorld2022], and only selected parks over 100 ha in size, in the IUCN categories Ia, Ib, II, and IV following the criteria of @boltonUncoveringRegionalVariability2019. These categories are considered strictly protected, with the primary goal of preserving ecosystem function, habitat, or species. Resource extraction activities are typically prohibited in these categories. This selection criteria led to a total of 753 suitable protected areas being selected for analysis.

## Data

### Forest Structure

We obtained forest structural attributes (canopy height, canopy cover, structural complexity, aboveground biomass) for BC from the NTEMS data archive, as generated by Matasci et al., [-@matasciLargeareaMappingCanadian2018; -@matasciThreeDecadesForest2018] at a 30-m spatial resolution. Their approach imputes airborne laser scanning plots across the landscape using a k-NN imputation model, with annual best-available-pixel (BAP) composites [@whitePixelBasedImageCompositing2014; @hermosillaMassDataProcessing2016], geographic location, and topography. The k-NN (k = 1) imputation model determines the most representative airborne laser scanning plot by generating random forest models for each attribute, and calculates a similarity measure based on the number of training samples which share the same leaf as the sample to be mapped. The forest structural attributes for the sample are then attributed at the same time, preserving the covariance structure of the data and ensuring there is no overextrapolation. This process resulted in accuracy metrics ranging from a RMSE% of 29.7% (structural complexity) to 65.8% (aboveground biomass), and R^2^ values ranging from 0.13 (structural complexity) to .70 (aboveground biomass) [@matasciLargeareaMappingCanadian2018; @matasciThreeDecadesForest2018].

### Forest Function

The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are a set of remote sensing-derived metrics that quantify vegetation productivity and seasonality, providing insight into habitat quality and ecosystem functioning [@coops2008]. The DHIs summarize vegetation productivity across three key dimensions: cumulative productivity, which represents total annual vegetation growth; seasonality, which captures the difference between peak and minimum productivity, reflecting ecosystem variability; and minimum productivity, which indicates the baseline level of vegetation greenness during the least productive time of the year. These indices have been widely used to assess biodiversity patterns, ecosystem resilience, and habitat suitability across a range of spatial and temporal scales [@radeloffDynamicHabitatIndices2019; @razenkovaExplainingBirdRichness2022; @andrewEcosystemClassificationsBased2013; @andrewFacetsFunctionalDiversity2024; @michaud2012; @holmesIndicatorsVegetationProductivity2015; @coopsBirdDiversityPredictable2009].

In this study, we used DHIs derived from Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data at a 30-m resolution, to match the forest structural attributes. To do this, we used Google Earth Engine [@gorelickGoogleEarthEngine2017] to generate a synthetic year of monthly Landsat data from 2010-2020 in forested pixels. We filtered out clouds, shadows, and cloud shadows using the QA band [@zhuObjectbasedCloudCloud2012], and calculated NDVI for each pixel. All NDVI values over the time span were assigned to a month, and the monthly median NDVI value was calculated. The DHIs were calculated as follows: cumulative DHI as the sum of monthly medians, variation DHI as the coefficient of variation of monthly medians, and minimum DHI as the minimum of monthly medians. Further details on DHI calculation can be found in @razenkovaMediumresolutionDynamicHabitat2025.

### Canadian Human Footprint

We used the Canadian Human Footprint layer developed by @hirsh-pearsonCanadaHumanFootprint2022, an additive human pressure map, to remove anthropogenically impacted areas from our reference states. They mapped the following pressures in a cumulative fashion: built environment, crop land, pasture land, human population density, nighttime lights, railways, roads, navigable waterways, dams and associated reservoirs, mining activity, oil and gas, and forestry. They assigned scores to each pressure based on intensity and proximity [@hirsh-pearsonCanadaHumanFootprint2022]. Their cumulative pressure map of Canada was originally generated at a 300-m spatial resolution, which we downsampled to 30-m using cubic spline resampling to match with the rest of our Landsat derived data.

### Forest Disturbances

We use a forest disturbance mask developed by @hermosillaIntegratedLandsatTime2015 to filter our disturbed pixels from our reference states, which includes fire, harvesting, and non-stand replacing disturbances. The forest disturbance mask was generated at a 30-m spatial resolution using the Composite2Change approach, which generates annual, cloud-free, BAP composites [@hermosillaMassDataProcessing2016] from freely available Landsat imagery from 1984-2022. The BAP composites were produced using the scoring function from @whitePixelBasedImageCompositing2014, and further screened for noise, changes, and data gaps using spectral trend analysis on the Normalized Burn Ratio of each pixel [@hermosillaRegionalDetectionCharacterization2015]. A random forest classifier was used to detect and attribute changes in an object-based analysis approach during the spectral trend analysis step. Disturbances were identified with a spatial accuracy of 92% ± 2%, and were identified within ± 1 year 97.7% of the time [@hermosillaMassDataProcessing2016].

### Forest Types

We used the VLCE land cover product developed by @hermosillaMappingPresenceDistribution2022 as a forest cover mask across British Columbia. Their methodology used BAP composites, vegetation indices, topographic, and hydrologic predictors with a regionally implemented random forests classifier [@breimanRandomForests2001] and refined calibration data to predict 12 land cover classes across Canada, with an overall accuracy of 77.9 ± 1.4% [@hermosillaMappingPresenceDistribution2022]. We focus on vegetated treed land cover classes, which includes coniferous, broadleaf, mixed wood, and wetland-treed [@wulderMonitoringCanadasForests2008].

### Climate and Topographic Information

We retrieved four climate variables from the ClimateNA software package for terrestrial British Columbia: mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), and mean warmest month temperature (MWMT). These were initially retrieved at a 1-km spatial resolution, and we downsampled them to a 30-m spatial resolution using cubic spline resampling in the **terra** (version 1.8.5) R package [@hijmansTerraSpatialData2025; @rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] to match the resolution of our core datasets for the analysis.

Lastly, we used a 30-m digital elevation model and derived slope from the ASTER Version 3 GDEM product [@abramsASTERGlobalDigital2020].

## Processing

### Reference States

We defined reference states as pixels within protected areas which showed no documented anthropogenic pressures or forest disturbances from the above datasets. This approach assumed that such protected areas exhibit high ecological integrity due to the absence of human impact [@hansen2021; @williams2025]. Additionally, the removal of stands experiencing forest disturbances post-1984 ensured that reference forest stands were at least 40 years old, having progressed out of early successional stages.

### Matching

To ensure that reference states were compared to similar forested pixels, we employed an expanded coarsened exact matching approach [@iacusCausalInferenceBalance2012]. This method controlled for ecosystem, forest type, climate, and topographic conditions. We divided climatic and topographic variables into five equal-sized quantiles, hereafter referred to as bins. We refer to each unique combination of bins as stratum. We prioritized exact matches between reference states and other pixels (i.e., identical strata, ecosystem, and forest type) while ensuring that each matched group contained at least 100 pixels. When exact matches were unavailable, we used a nearest neighbors approach, selecting the closest matches in quantile space while still maintaining a minimum of 100 pixels per group. To ensure reliability, we calculated the mean nearest neighbor distance for each stratum. Pixels with a mean nearest neighbor distance greater than two were excluded from further analysis, as they were considered too environmentally dissimilar to any available reference state. If an entire ecosystem lacked suitable reference states (e.g., due to widespread anthropogenic pressures in its protected areas), we expanded the search province-wide, allowing matches to be drawn from any part of British Columbia, provided they had identical strata and forest types.

### Integrity

To estimate ecological integrity, we calculated sigma dissimilarity [@mahonyCloserLookNovel2017], a transformation of the Mahalanobis distance that accounts for covariance structures in multi-dimensional data. The Mahalanobis distance was computed by first applying a principal components transformation to our input data (i.e., structural and functional attributes). The standardized Euclidean distance was then calculated in this transformed space. We standardized the distance along each principal component using either the global standard deviation or the stratum-specific standard deviation, whichever was lower. We used the IncrementalPCA function from **Scikit-learn** (version 1.6.1) to compute principal components on 1000 × 1000 pixel tiles, as the full dataset exceeded memory constraints. Since Mahalanobis distance follows a chi distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of dimensions, we converted these values into percentiles. These percentiles were then transformed into a chi distribution with a single degree of freedom (i.e., a half-normal distribution), yielding the sigma dissimilarity metric. We categorized structural, functional, and structural + functional integrity as any pixel with a dissimilarity value less than two for each metric, indicating it is within two standard deviations of the matched reference state in multivariate space.

## Analysis

### Matching

We report the proportion of perfect matches, suitable matches (within 2 nearest neighbour distances), matches outside the BEC zone, and no suitable match by BEC zone to assess the environmental coverage of the protected area network across British Columbia and identify missing strata from the protected area system. We also identify ecosystems without suitable reference states due to the presence of high anthropogenic pressures across the entire region.

### Integrity

We combined our structural and functional integrity metrics with the human footprint layer to generate integrity-pressure maps across terrestrial British Columbia. We considered a Canadian Human footprint score above four as being under high pressure, which has been shown to increase vertebrate species endangerment trends [@pillay2024], following @hansenPolicydrivenFrameworkConserving2020. We report the proportion of integrity-pressure categories for the entire province and by ecosystem for both forest structure and function. To assess the effectiveness of protected areas at mitigating anthropogenic pressure, we compare the proportions of high-integrity forests across the pressure gradient between protected (excluding pixels defined as the reference state) and unprotected areas. Since our integrity calculation involved a matching step to ensure comparability to similar environmental conditions, we did not perform an additional matching step. We also calculated the proportions of high-integrity forests prior to, during, and after disturbances to assess their impact on forest integrity.

# Results

## Matching

Using our expanded coarsened exact matching method, we found that approximately 80% of forested pixels in British Columbia had an available perfectly matched reference state (@fig-matching A). The majority of all zones had suitable or perfect matches. Less than 1% of British Columbia did not have a match, with the majority of this area found in the Interior Mountain-heather Alpine (IMA) BEC zone, which is an alpine ecosystem. Only two BEC zones had to expand their matching search outside of themselves, namely Coastal Douglas-fir (CDF) and Bunchgrass (BG). CDF was entirely matched outside the BEC zone, while only \~8% of BG was matched outside the BEC zone.

## Integrity

We found that approximately 55% of the forested area of British Columbia had high structural integrity, 73% had high functional integrity, and 45% had high structural + functional integrity when compared to the reference states(@fig-intact-bc). Using the BEC classification system, CDF and BG, both subject to significant anthropogenic pressure, were among had the lowest amount of high-integrity forests across all three metrics, with Ponderosa Pine (PP), a relatively rare, high elevation, dry forest type, having the least amount of high functionally integrity forests. The rest of the BEC zones generally followed similar patterns to the BC wide average. Spatially, the more boreal influenced northeast of the province typically had more high-integrity forests across all three metrics, although high-integrity areas can be found throughout the province for both the structural and functional metrics. The islands off of the coast of mainland British Columbia (Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii) had much more high functional integrity forests than high structural or structural + functional integrity forests (@fig-intact-bc).

```

Generally, as expected, we found that disturbances reduced the proportion of high-integrity forests in years following the disturbance (@fig-tsd). Forest harvest had the largest impact on all three metrics, although high functional integrity proportions were the quickest to recover. Non-stand replacing disturbances, such as low intensity fire, disease, and insects, typically had a smaller impact on integrity proportions with a quicker recovery, although we did not see a reduction in functional integrity following non-stand replacing disturbances. Non stand-replacing disturbances showed lower high-integrity proportions for structural and structural + functional integrity during the year of the disturbance, however they immediately returned to pre-disturbance high-integrity proportions. Stand replacing forest fires led to a reduction in the proportion of high-integrity forests, however, following the disturbance they returned to pre-disturbance levels more quickly than harvest, although the recovery was more temporally variable.

```

The proportion of high-integrity forest by metric varied across human footprint categories (@fig-area-hf). The majority of British Columbia was considered to be under low pressure (Canadian human footprint from 0-4). Proportions of high-integrity forests across all three metrics were reduced as anthropogenic pressures increased, with the smallest changes being in high functional integrity forests with increasing pressure.

We did not find large differences between protected and unprotected areas for integrity proportions across any of the metrics. High structural integrity forests were slightly more common in protected than unprotected areas with increasing anthropogenic pressure, however the response to increased pressure on functional and structural + functional integrity was more variable. Proportions of high functional integrity forests were similar across all levels of anthropogenic pressure, although it was slightly higher in forests with no anthropogenic pressure.

# Discussion

## Ecological integrity mapping

Ecologically intact forests are key for conserving imperiled biodiversity and preserving ecosystem services [@watson2018]. However, metrics for mapping intact forests as a fine-spatial scale have been underexplored despite their critical need, however, see @hansenPolicydrivenFrameworkConserving2020 for an example in tropical moist forests. Typically, intact forest ecosystem mapping solely looks at anthropogenic pressures, and considers their absence at a given scale to be an intact ecosystem [@hirsh-pearsonCanadaHumanFootprint2022]. However, this does not consider fine-scale ecological integrity, which is integral for preserving biodiversity by providing the habitat needed for species to thrive, in addition to the absence of pressures [@macarthur1961; @karrEcologicalIntegrityBoth2022]. We apply both strategies by generating a pressure/integrity matrix, and mapping that across the forested ecosystems of British Columbia (@fig-intact-bc).

We found that increasing anthropogenic pressure led to reductions in the proportion of high-integrity forests across British Columbia (@fig-area-hf). While our integrity metrics are based on stand level indicators of structure (canopy height, cover, complexity, and aboveground biomass) and function (annual energy availability and seasonality), other research on this topic typically focuses on landscape level impacts, such as fragmentation and connectivity [@granthamAnthropogenicModificationForests2020]. @liHumanFingerprintStructural2023 also found a reduction in forest structural density with increasing anthropogenic pressure across the globe, however, their analysis unit was a 5.5 km-grid cell. Here, our use of Landsat-derived forest structural [@matasciLargeareaMappingCanadian2018; @matasciThreeDecadesForest2018] and functional [@razenkovaMediumresolutionDynamicHabitat2025] attributes allows us to map integrity and the impacts of the human footprint at a much finer spatial resolution.

We also found that protected areas generally had similar proportions of high functionally integrity forests to unprotected areas, however, protected areas had increased levels of structural integrity when compared to unprotected areas. This pattern became more apparent with increasing levels of anthropogenic pressure (@fig-pro-unpro), indicating that protected areas are effective at reducing the impacts of anthropogenic pressures, in line with a recent global analysis of protected area effectiveness [@geldmann2019], and that highly protected areas (IUCN categories Ia, Ib, and II) have better ecological condition [@williams2025]. This could possibly be due to the reduction in harvesting disturbances typical of protected areas [@boltonUncoveringRegionalVariability2019], which we found led to strong reductions in integrity in the years following the disturbance (@fig-tsd). We found a similar pattern for fire, although functional integrity was significantly more variable in post-fire stands, which aligns with the previous findings of @whiteNationwideAnnualCharacterization2017. Notably, non-stand replacing disturbances did not lead to a marked decrease in proportion of high structural or functional integrity forests beyond the focal year, indicating that low-intensity disturbances, likely within the natural disturbance regime, led to smaller impacts on forest integrity [@danielsDisturbanceRegimesCoastal2006; @haughianExpectedEffectsClimate2012].

The sigma dissimilarity metric was originally developed to assess novel climatic conditions under a changing climate [@mahonyCloserLookNovel2017]. Here we expand its usage to assess forest ecological integrity, by comparing forest structure and functional attributes to climatically and topographically matched protected areas, in line with a commonly accepted definition of ecological integrity [@hansen2021; @tierney2009]. While the concept of "novel" does not directly apply to forest structure and function, it does allow us to identify multivariate structural and functional outliers. This assumes that protected areas comprise all of the variation on high-integrity structural and functional attributes. Protected areas have been shown to be biased towards low-productivity, remote, regions both globally [@joppa2009], and within British Columbia [@muise2022]. We circumvent this bias by using our matching approach to ensure environmental similarity between reference states and other forests.

Using our CEM approach, we found that \~80% of the province had perfect matches, meaning there is a protected ecosystem with the same BEC zone, forest type, climate, and topography (@fig-matching), indicating good protected area coverage of the range of environmental conditions in British Columbia. Notably, some ecosystems do not follow this average trend, and these regions and missing environments could be focused on for protected area expansion [@alagadorShiftingProtectedAreas2014]. This is especially relevant under our changing climate, where novel climates will appear [@mahonyCloserLookNovel2017; @mahony2018], and current reference states may no longer be attainable [@mcnellieReferenceStateBenchmark2020].

## Methodological considerations

Coarsened exact matching (CEM) was used to derive our reference states, a method that offers distinct advantages over alternative matching techniques, particularly within the context of assessing forest integrity. Other matching methods, such as propensity score matching, seek to balance covariates between treatment and control groups by estimating the probability of being in the treatment group [@austinIntroductionPropensityScore2011]. In our case, this could lead to two pixels having similar chances of being protected, but entirely different environmental conditions. Whereas CEM ensures that environmental conditions are matched, and thus that our integrity metrics considers climatic and topographic conditions. Further, CEM is computationally efficient for large datasets, allowing for robust analysis across the extensive forested regions of British Columbia at a fine spatial scale, and provides a more transparent and interpretable matching process compared to other methods, enhancing the reliability and clarity of our results.

A notable methodological challenge was the identification of suitable reference states in ecosystems under heavy anthropogenic pressures. In some cases, such as in the Coastal Douglas-fir ecosystem, the high degree of anthropogenic modification resulted in the absence of suitable reference states - there were no protected areas free of anthropogenic pressure (@fig-matching). We circumvent this by expanding our search to environmentally similar forest stands in other ecosystems, however, this does introduce additional uncertainty to our analysis. Beyond being a methodological challenge, this indicates that there is not a suitable contemporary reference state available within the protected area network [@mcnellieReferenceStateBenchmark2020].

We also note a temporal mismatch in reduced proportions of functional integrity forests prior to our focal year (2015; @fig-tsd). Notably, the functional integrity reduction happens approximately 5 years before the focal year, which aligns with the synthetic year of data used to generate the DHIs, which includes data from 2010-2020 [@razenkovaMediumresolutionDynamicHabitat2025]. This temporal discrepancy raises concerns about the accuracy of attributing changes in functional integrity precisely to the year of a specific disturbance event within the synthetic data range. The use of a synthetic year of Landsat data, while valuable for gap-filling and generating continuous metrics like the DHIs, inherently involves a temporal averaging of signals. Consequently, this can smooth out or displace abrupt changes that would be captured in single-year analyses. For instance, a disturbance occurring in 2012 might influence the median NDVI values used to calculate DHIs, and thus affect functional integrity in a way that appears to precede or lag behind the actual disturbance year. This highlights the need to exercise caution when examining temporally infilled datasets alongside disturbance records, and the benefits of increased revisit times when compatible satellites such as Landsat and Sentinel are used together as a constellation [@claverie2018; @radeloff2024].

# Conclusion

This study presents a novel, scalable framework for assessing ecological integrity across forested ecosystems using satellite-derived structural and functional indicators integrated with coarsened exact matching. By grounding integrity assessments in environmentally consistent reference conditions, we generated spatially explicit, fine-scale estimates of forest integrity across British Columbia. Our results reveal that while a majority of forested areas maintain functional integrity, structural integrity is more frequently degraded, particularly in regions subject to anthropogenic pressures such as harvesting and infrastructure development. Importantly, we found that protected areas confer small but measurable benefits to structural integrity, especially in landscapes experiencing high pressure. However, gaps in protected area representation persist for certain ecosystems, highlighting opportunities for targeted conservation expansion, which could also integrate integrity measurements. The framework developed here provides a powerful tool for monitoring ecosystem condition in support of international biodiversity targets and offers actionable insights to guide protection and restoration efforts in forest management and policy.
